Strategy design pattern is behavioral design pattern where we choose a specific implementation of algorithm or task in run time – out of multiple other implementations for same task.

The important point is that these implementations are interchangeable – based on task a implementation may be picked without disturbing the application workflow.

In Strategy pattern, we first create an abstraction of algorithm. 
This is an interface having the abstract operation. Then we create implementations of this abstraction and these are called strategies.
