It is a creational design pattern which talks about the creation of an object.
The factory design pattern says that define an interface ( A java interface or an abstract class) and let the subclasses decide which object to instantiate. The factory method in the interface lets a class defer the instantiation to one or more concrete subclasses. 
Since this design patterns talk about instantiation of an object and so it comes under the category of creational design pattern

Factory design pattern is most suitable when complex object creation steps are involved. To ensure that these steps are centralized and not exposed to composing classes.
